                    <h3>About Persian Carpet</h3>
                    <p>A Persian carpet also known as Iranian carpet, is a heavy textile made for
                        a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purposes and produced in Iran (historically known as
                        Persia), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is
                        an essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art. Within the group of Oriental rugs produced
                        by the countries of the "rug belt", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and
                        elaborateness
                        of its manifold designs.
                        <br>
                        Persian rugs and carpets of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes in village
                        and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent
                        miscellaneous,
                        simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran, Persian culture, and its
                        various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the
                        sixteenth
                        century are famous for their elaborate colors and artistical design, and are treasured in
                        museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an
                        artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of
                        the Persian
                        Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.
                        <br>
                        Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Ravar, Neyshabour, Mashhad,
                        Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of
                        high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have
                        played an
                        important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline.
                        Rugs woven
                        by the villagers and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and
                        elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often
                        produce
                        rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic
                        and
                        traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger
                        workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.
                        As a result of political unrest or commercial pressure, carpet weaving has gone through periods
                        of decline throughout the decades. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic
                        dyes
                        during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a critical role in
                        the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional
                        dyeing
                        with natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention
                        of
                        modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian rugs and
                        carpets have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since
                        the
                        first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.
                        <br>
                        Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets
                        and rugs like Kilim, Soumak, and embroidered tissues like Suzani are part of the rich and
                        manifold
                        tradition of Persian carpet weaving.
                        <br>
                        In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in Fars Province and Kashan were inscribed
                        to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

                    <h3>Qashqai Carpet</h3>
                    <p>The Ghashghai nomads are found in the Fars province in the southwest of Iran and they live in the
                        provinces of Fars, Khuzestan and Southern Isfahan but mostly in the surroundings of Shiraz. They
                        move twice a year, between the winter pasture near the Persian Gulf and the summer pasture up in
                        the Zagros mountains where it is much cooler. During the move it is possible to see the men with
                        their typical round hats, running together with their dogs, large flock of sheep and herds of
                        goats, along the roads swirling with clouds of dust. The women in their colourful clothes move
                        along with the help of donkeys and horses towards new camp grounds. The tents that they live in
                        are often made from goat hair.
                        <br>
                        The manufacturing of carpets as well as kelims, bags, ribbons and other decorations is an
                        important contribution to the life of the nomads. The carpets have a typical red-brown ground
                        colour. The pattern is tied from memory and often consists of a centrally placed medallion,
                        repeated in all four corners. Humans, four legged animals, birds, trees and flowers are popular
                        elements. Other patterns are collected from frescos and columns in Persepolis (Tacht-e-Jamshid
                        in Persia ) the ceremonial capital during the Achmenids dynasty (550-330 B.C.). They are also
                        wellknown for their beautiful sadle bags that are knotted for more practical reasons.
                        <br>
                        The carpets are woven on horizontal looms and the weaver sits during the weaving process on the
                        half made part of the carpet. Semi nomads, who are resident during part of the year, weave
                        carpets in the same way. A specially well-woven carpet is know as a Kashkooli. Gabbeh signifies
                        a rough and primitive nomadic carpet from the area. During the last decades, the weaver had to
                        oblige to the western desires and began to use large brighter fields with few patterns in the
                        Gabbeh carpets. Well-made Ghashghai carpets are attractive and durable products that tells a lot
                        about the conditions of the nomadic life. The carpet is made entirely of wool from sheep and
                        goats with some horse hair. The carpets can also be known as Qashqai, Gashghai, Gaschgai or
                        Kashgai carpets.
                        <br>
                        Most of the Ghasghai nomads have now settled in towns and villages. Their carpets are therefore
                        more directly influenced by market demands. These carpets in comparison to other nomadic tribal
                        carpets are more coarsely woven and have cotton warps. More simple carpets from the area are
                        sold under the name Shiraz. It is also the name of the provincial capital and in these bazaars
                        the Ghashghai carpets are sold. The bazaars are also a common place where the nomads purchase
                        other products they may use in their everyday life.
                        <br>
                        Ghashghai carpets consist of a hexagon or diamond with four projecting hooks inside of a hooked
                        diamond. Some Ghasghai pieces have the Hebatlu design (Hebatlu is the name of one of the one of
                        the smaller Ghasghai tribes) and it consists of circular central medallion, and smaller designs
                        similar to the central medallion repeated on each of the four corners of the carpet. The
                        Ghasghai kelims tend to be woven in one piece with cotton sometimes used as highlights. The have
                        simple designs and the warp is normally finished in long braids. The tribe that are well known
                        for making the Kelims are the Amaleh and Darashuri.

                    <h3>Gabbeh</h3>
                    <p>Gabbeh (from the Persian language farsi; raw, natural, uncut) represents a rough and primitive
                        carpet with patterns mostly made by Ghashghai nomads from the Farsi province in the southwest of
                        Iran. These carpets are probably the most well-known handmade carpets from Iran. They are
                        manufactured by handspun wool, both in the pile and warp, and the yarns are dyed using plant
                        dyes. The carpets are much thicker than other Persian carpets, sometimes up to 2.5 cm thick.
                        <br>
                        The patterns of the carpet are of a simple type with only a few elements of decorative, mostly
                        rectangular objects containing animals. During the last decades, the weavers have had to meet
                        the demands of the west and have therefore, resorted to using large light fields with chary
                        pattering in the Gabbeh carpets.
                        <br>
                        Weavers from India have acted quickly to copy these carpets, but one must pay attention to this
                        as there is a major difference between a Persian and a Indo Gabbeh carpet. Mostly this can be
                        determined by the quality of the wool that is noticable, the Persian variant is much softer. The
                        Persian variant is also much more durable and the quality is definitely better.
                        <br>
                        At present, there are different names given to Gabbeh carpets such as Basic, Amalehbaft,
                        Kashkooli, Luribaft, Sumak and Baluch Gabbeh. A Gabbeh Kashkooli is a carpet with a higher knot
                        density and a shorter pile than the usual Gabbeh carpets.

                    <h3>Kerman Carpet</h3>
                    <p>Down in the southeast of Iran, close to an oasis in the desert Dasht-e-Lut lies the city of
                        Kerman with a population of approximately 350 000 inhabitants. The distance to Teheran is more
                        than 1 000 kilometres and the city was founded in the 4th century and had great importance for
                        the people who were travelling far along the trading routes between Iran and India. During the
                        centuries different masters have ruled the city, for example Arabs, Seljuks and Mongolians.
                        <br>
                        Until a few years ago Kerman was a good starting-point for the people wanting to visit the old
                        fortress city of Bam, about 200 kilometres south. Bam was on of the most greatest tourist
                        attractions in Iran, but was destroyed by an earthquake around Christmas 2003, killing 10 000
                        peoples.
                        <br>
                        The city of Kerman today has a pleasant atmosphere with mosques, blocks with bazaars and tea
                        houses. The carpet manufacturing has long been an important industry and carpets from Kerman are
                        easily recognized. The ground colour is often red, and the pattern is dominated by a centrally
                        placed medallion together with a wide border filled with flowers. The carpets that were
                        manufactured before World War I usually have different motifs, such as trees, animals and
                        figural motifs. The material as well as the design is usually of good quality.
                        <br>
                        The carpets were considered to be the best among the Iranian carpets, but the newer productions
                        are unfortunately of low quality sometimes. Modern carpets with the name Kerman-Lavar often come
                        with all-over floral motifs in clear colours. The carpets are also sold under the name Kirman.

                    <p>The city of Moud is situated south of Mashad and south of Birdjan. The carpets from Moud often
                        have a Herati pattern , with or without a centrally placed medallion. They are sometimes divided
                        into Moud Mahi and Moud Garden . The first one mentioned, Mahi, often has a beige colour with a
                        light red or blue nuance and a star shaped medallion. The other, Garden, reminds one about
                        Bakhtiar carpets, illustrated with a curvilinear garden motif.
                        <br>
                        The weavers uses double wefts and the workmanship is often of good quality. In both types silk
                        is used to bring out the lustre in the pile. Other carpets from this area are Birjand and
                        Kashmar.

                    <h3>Tabriz Carpet</h3>
                    <p>The city of Tabriz is situated 600 km west of Teheran and one of the largest cities in Iran and
                        also the captial in the province of Azerbajdzjan. The population comprising of the Azaris, who
                        are the largest ethnic minority in Iran and speak the Turkish dialect. The city is old and has
                        for centuries been a very important trading place and border station. Known attractions are the
                        Blue Mosque and the giant bazaar.
                        <br>
                        The manufacturing of carpets today is extensive and the quality varies from excellent
                        handicrafts to simple and cheap bazaar qualities. A good Tabriz has a short and rough pile. The
                        patterns can consist of a centrally placed medallion surrounded by arabesques, weeping willows
                        and cypresses. Another popular motif is the four seasons which describes the life of the Persian
                        farmer during spring, summer, autumn and winter.
                        <br>
                        Ancient palaces and ruins are often seen on the carpets. On the corners it is sometimes possible
                        to see the four great Persian poets: Sadi, Hafez, Ferdowsi and Omar Khayam.
                        <br>
                        The term Raj in connection with the name of Tabriz carpets refers to the number of knots in a 70
                        mm span range. The denomination 40 Raj refers to carpets with 400-500.000 knots/m2, 50 Raj to

                        70 Raj to carpets with approximately 800-1.000.000 knots/m2. The last mentioned being extremely
                        rare on today's market.

                    <h3>Sarouk Carpet</h3>
                    <p>Sarouk does not have very long experience in carpet weaving, but it rescued the carpet industry
                        during the world wars in the 20th century. Before American companies were established in this
                        small city, Tabriz merchants managed the carpet industry in Sarouk. Still, after a downturn,
                        along with the First World War and the stagnation of Sultanabad rugs, Sarouk rugs attracted
                        American merchants. Still, they wanted some special orders, like rugs with low height piles,
                        allover designs, and a central field of red.
                        Thus the particular style of Sarouk rug was created with high densities and well handspun wool,
                        professional weaving techniques, and regulated designs. Foreign consumers' desires and the
                        unique taste of rustic Sarouk weavers make the extraordinary style of the Sarouk rug.</p>

                    <h3>Nahavand Carpet</h3>
                    <p>The ancient city of Nahavand in western Iran is one of Iran's leading rug-proveniences. It
                        produces high quality Persian rugs, which have a very good reputation.

                        Usually a very shiny wool is used, which gives the patterns and design of the carpet a strong
                        personality. The robust carpets have a retilinear design, partly inspired by nomadic rugs. A
                        central centre medallion sets the tone in many cases. It is decorated with leaf, flower and
                        branch motifs. It is framed by floral patterns that are stylized. Vases, for example, are a
                        popular motif. The beautifully combined colours mostly consist of red and beige tones, which
                        unfold on a blue background.</p>
