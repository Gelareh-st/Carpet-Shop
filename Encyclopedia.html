                    Persian carpet
                    stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs. Persian rugs and carpets of
                    various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes in village and town workshops, and by royal
                    court manufactories alike. As such, they represent miscellaneous, simultaneous lines of tradition,
                    and reflect the history of Iran, Persian culture, and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the
                    Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate
                    colors and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the
                    world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which
                    was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of
                    Iran. Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Ravar, Neyshabour, Mashhad,
                    Kashan, Isfahan, Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of
                    high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an
                    important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs
                    woven by the villagers and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and
                    elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often
                    produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most
                    authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the
                    larger workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition. As a
                    result of political unrest or commercial pressure, carpet weaving has gone through periods of
                    decline throughout the decades. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes
                    during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a critical role in the

                </label>
                <p id="about-persian-carpet">A Persian carpet also known as Iranian carpet, is a heavy textile made for
                    a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purposes and produced
                    in Iran (historically known as Persia), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an
                    essential part of Persian culture and Iranian art. Within the group of Oriental rugs produced by the
                    countries of the "rug belt", the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its
                    manifold designs.

                    Persian rugs and carpets of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes in village and
                    town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent miscellaneous,
                    simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the history of Iran, Persian culture, and its various
                    peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth
                    century are famous for their elaborate colors and artistical design, and are treasured in museums
                    and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic
                    tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian
                    Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

                    Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like Tabriz, Kerman, Ravar, Neyshabour, Mashhad, Kashan,
                    Isfahan, Nain and Qom are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality
                    materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of Tabriz have played an important
                    historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by
                    the villagers and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate
                    colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs
                    with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and
                    traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger
                    workplaces. Gabbeh rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.

                    As a result of political unrest or commercial pressure, carpet weaving has gone through periods of
                    decline throughout the decades. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes
                    during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a critical role in the
                    economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with
                    natural dyes, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern
                    and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian rugs and carpets
                    have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first
                    time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.

                    Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and
                    rugs like Kilim, Soumak, and embroidered tissues like Suzani are part of the rich and manifold
                    tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

                    In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in Fars Province and Kashan were inscribed to
                    the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.</p>
